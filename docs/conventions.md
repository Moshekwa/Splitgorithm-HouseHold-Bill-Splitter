StandardJS is the coding style that will be used throughout the project.

Code Review Guidelines Include : 
1. Have a goal - This includes a list of common goals, which every member of a team believes in
2. Create your own checklist - Think of what you need to pay attention to when reviewing code
3. Automate - Automate as much as it is possible. In most cases, style checking can be fully automated
4. Think of change aim - 
5. Look for tests - Check if there are automated tests created for a given piece of code. If you think that it is applicable,
 and tests are not yet created, offer to do so.
6. When commenting 
  6.1 Consider whether commenting will bring any value. If not, you can fix it by yourself,
   as a whole team is responsible for code quality.
  6.2 You don’t have to be always right, and a comment should be a beginning of discussion,
   not just a change. Try to coach the author.
  6.3 You don’t have to always use CR service for discussion . The author of the code isn’t another user of CR tool,
  he’s another team member. Therefore, don’t hesitate, just present your doubts directly to him. 
  Sometimes, it is better and faster solution.
7. Positive Feedback - When you find some inspiring piece of code, share it with the team. 
   It will motivate an author and may be useful for the rest.
8. Maintain process - You don’t have to follow all the assumptions that were set when Code Review process started.
  If you feel that something should be changed, just change it.
